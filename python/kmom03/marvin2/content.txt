Dear diary.

Today is {0}, the time is {1}. Today I am feeling {2}, why? Well
because it's raining outside. This is the {3}th time this month that it's
raining.

Diary, did you know that there is exactly {4} Daleks left in
this world? I know, it may seem like an odd number, but it's true!

Well, that's all I have for today, Diary. See you next time.
